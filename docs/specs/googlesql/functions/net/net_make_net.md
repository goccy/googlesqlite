## `NET.MAKE_NET`

```
NET.MAKE_NET(address, prefix_length)
```

**Description**

Takes an IPv4 or IPv6 address as STRING and an integer representing the prefix
length (the number of leading 1-bits in the network mask). Returns a
STRING representing the [CIDR subnet][net-link-to-cidr-notation] with the given prefix length.

The value of `prefix_length` must be greater than or equal to 0. A smaller value
means a bigger subnet, covering more IP addresses. The result CIDR subnet must
be no smaller than `address`, meaning that the value of `prefix_length` must be
less than or equal to the prefix length in `address`. See the effective upper
bound below.

This function supports the following formats for `address`:

+ IPv4: Dotted-quad format, such as `10.1.2.3`. The value of `prefix_length`
  must be less than or equal to 32.
+ IPv6: Colon-separated format, such as
  `1234:5678:90ab:cdef:1234:5678:90ab:cdef`. The value of `prefix_length` must
  be less than or equal to 128.
+ CIDR (IPv4): Dotted-quad format, such as `10.1.2.0/24`.
  The value of `prefix_length` must be less than or equal to the number after
  the slash in `address` (24 in the example), which must be less than or equal
  to 32.
+ CIDR (IPv6): Colon-separated format, such as `1:2::/48`.
  The value of `prefix_length` must be less than or equal to the number after
  the slash in `address` (48 in the example), which must be less than or equal
  to 128.

If this function receives a `NULL` input, it returns `NULL`. If the input is
considered invalid, an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error occurs.
