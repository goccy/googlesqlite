name: ANON_VAR_POP
dialect: googlesql
category: functions/aggregate/differential_privacy
status: implemented
notes: |
  ANON_VAR_POP alias of the differential-privacy VAR_POP.
  
  Implementation lives in internal/functions/aggregate/dp.go;
  the analyzer's Anonymization rewriter is enabled in
  internal/analyzer.go and lowers SELECT WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY
  / ANONYMIZATION queries into $differential_privacy_<op> /
  $anon_<op> aggregate calls. The DifferentialPrivacyAggregateScan
  handler in internal/formatter.go captures the per-scan
  (epsilon, delta) options and appends them as runtime args to
  every DP aggregate call. Catalog registration of the internal
  $-prefixed signatures uses BuiltinFunctionOptions.IncludeFunctionIds
  (see newDPBuiltinFunctionOptions in internal/catalog.go).

## `ANON_VAR_POP` (DEPRECATED) 
<a id="anon_var_pop"></a>

Warning: This function has been deprecated. Use
`VAR_POP` (differential privacy) instead.

```googlesql
WITH ANONYMIZATION ...
  ANON_VAR_POP(expression [CLAMPED BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound])
```

**Description**

Takes an expression and computes the population (biased) variance of the values
in the expression. The final result is an aggregation across
privacy unit columns between `0` and `+Inf`. You can
[clamp the input values][dp-clamp-explicit] explicitly, otherwise input values
are clamped implicitly. Clamping is performed per individual entity values.

This function must be used with the `ANONYMIZATION` clause and
can support these arguments:

+ `expression`: The input expression. This can be any numeric input type,
  such as `INT64`. `NULL`s are always ignored.
+ `CLAMPED BETWEEN` clause:
  Perform [clamping][dp-clamping] per individual entity values.

`NUMERIC` and `BIGNUMERIC` arguments aren't allowed.
 If you need them, cast them as the
`DOUBLE` data type first.

**Return type**

`DOUBLE`

**Examples**

The following differentially private query gets the
population (biased) variance of items requested. Smaller aggregations might not
be included. This query references a view called
[`view_on_professors`][dp-example-views].

```googlesql
-- With noise, using the epsilon parameter.
SELECT
  WITH ANONYMIZATION
    OPTIONS(epsilon=10, delta=.01, max_groups_contributed=1)
    item,
    ANON_VAR_POP(quantity CLAMPED BETWEEN 0 AND 100) pop_variance
FROM {{USERNAME}}.view_on_professors
GROUP BY item;

-- These results will change each time you run the query.
-- Smaller aggregations might be removed.
